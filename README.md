A system analyst is a professional who supports project processes within a company. They focus on identifying and solving existing systemsâ€™ problems, enhancing them, and training and motivating personnel to utilize the improvements effectively. To improve the quality and efficiency of their work, system analysts use various software tools known as CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools. These tools help automate manual tasks, create diagrams for better visualization and communication of projects and processes, and simplify documentation, leading to reduced costs, more development time, and improved quality.

Taking a system analyst course as part of my degree is essential for developing the skills to identify, analyze, and resolve issues in my career. Furthermore, communication with peers is a crucial aspect of my field of study, emphasized in the system analyst course.
